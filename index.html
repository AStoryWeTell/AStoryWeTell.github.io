<p><b>Plan</b></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Session 1: panel discussion (1 hour). Is consciousness a story we tell ourselves?</li>
<li>Session 2: contributed talks (1 hour). A set of four or five short talks.</li>
<li>Session 3: panel discussion (1 hour). Is consciousness an experimental question?</li>
</ul></p>

<p><b>Description</b></p>


<p>The aim of this symposium is to consider
  <ul>
    <li>The relationship between language and consciousness</li>
    <li>Language and inference in humans and machines</li>
    <li>The influence the role of language has on its structure.</li>
  </ul>
  and to suggest what key experiment could help address the
  relationship between language, consciousness and intelligence.
  </p>

<p>Consciousness may arise from, or be structured by, our ability to
access and reason about internal representations through the internal
use of language. This half-day symposium will address the question:
“Is consciousness a story we tell ourselves?” by examining the
relationship between consciousness, inner speech in humans and
chain-of-thought reasoning in machines.</p>

<p>Many theories of consciousness assume some role for internal
representations. However, language has often been treated as
secondary. This is surprising. although language is most obviously a
tool for communication, it provides the structured, sequential space
in which humans build multi-step inferences.</p>

<p>Questions of consciousness have a new urgency because of the recent
machine learning revolution. Chain-of-thought reasoning in large
language models provides a striking parallel: models become more
capable when they are allowed to "talk to themselves", producing
  extended internal sequences that guide inference.</p>

<p>This field lacks an agreed experimental programme but is rich in
experimental questions. To what extent can we disrupt inner speech
without fragmenting conscious experience? Can non-human animals or
artificial systems support forms of consciousness? What are the
crucial questions that are capable of empirical resolution?</p>
