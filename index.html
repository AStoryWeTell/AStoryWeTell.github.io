<p><b>Key dates</b></p>

	<p>There will be a session for 15 minute contributed talks. If you would like to take part submit an abstract of less than 400 words by <b>31 March</b> to:
	  <ul>
	    <li><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=astory2026">easychair.org/conferences/?conf=astory2026</a></li>
	  </ul>
	  All decisions will be made by <b>15 April</b>.</p>

<p><b>Plan</b></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Session 1: panel discussion (1 hour). Is consciousness a story we tell ourselves?</li>
<li>Session 2: contributed talks (1 hour). A set of four or five short talks.</li>
<li>Session 3: panel discussion (1 hour). Is consciousness an experimental question?</li>
</ul></p>

<p><b>Description</b></p>

<p>Consciousness may arise from, or be structured by, our ability to
access and reason about internal representations through the internal
use of language. This half-day symposium will address the question:
“Is consciousness a story we tell ourselves?” by examining the
relationship between consciousness, inner speech in humans and
chain-of-thought reasoning in machines.</p>

<p>Many theories of consciousness assume some role for internal
representations, but articulate this in different ways: as
higher-order thoughts, global workspace broadcasts, predictive
processing hierarchies, or self-model mechanisms. However, language
has often been treated as secondary. This is surprising.</p>

<p>The aim of this symposium is to consider
  <ul>
    <li>The relationship between language and consciousness</li>
    <li>Language and inference in humans and machines</li>
    <li>The influence the role of language has on its structure.</li>
  </ul>
  and to suggest what key experiment could help address the relationship between language, consciousness and intelligence.
