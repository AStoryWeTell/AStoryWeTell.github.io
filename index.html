<p><b>Key dates</b></p>

<p>There will be a call for contributed talks; the date will be announced shortly.</p>

<p><b>Description</b></p>

<p>Consciousness may arise from, or be structured by, our ability to
access and reason about internal representations through the internal
use of language. This half-day symposium will address the question:
“Is consciousness a story we tell ourselves?” by examining the
relationship between consciousness, inner speech in humans and
chain-of-thought reasoning in machines.</p>

<p>Many theories of consciousness assume some role for internal
representations, but articulate this in different ways: as
higher-order thoughts, global workspace broadcasts, predictive
processing hierarchies, or self-model mechanisms. However, language
has often been treated as secondary. This is surprising.</p>

<p>The aim of this symposium is to consider
  <ul>
    <li>The relationship between language and consciousness</li>
    <li>Language and inference in humans and machines</li>
    <li>The influence the role of language has on its structure.</li>
  </ul>
  and to suggest what key experiment could help address the relationship between language, consciousness and intelligence.
